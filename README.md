# Node Zippopotamus
---

*Node Zippopotamus* is an API wrapper for the **Zippopotamus** zip (and postal code) service.  This wrapper makes the process of submitting requests to the API as easy and having the country code and zip code to query for.  The results are returned according to the return formatting of the API itself.

*Node Zippopotamus* provides the following functionality:

- Query for information (including location) of a zip (or postal code)
- **Upcoming:** Cache results for increased efficiency and to make fewer requests to the API

## Installation

```npm install --save zippopotamus```

## Contributing

This project was built using Babel Stage 0. I am open to anyone who wishes to fork the project and create new test cases, add useful functionality, or anything else. I use this project in my own work so I will be adding to this library as functionality arises that I need.

All I ask is that if you add functionality please provide the necessary test cases and try to get as high code coverage as possible.
